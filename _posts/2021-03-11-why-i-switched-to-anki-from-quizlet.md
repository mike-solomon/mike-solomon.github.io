Last week, I [wrote a post](https://mike-solomon.github.io/quizlet-japanese/)
about how I was excited to find Quizlet and how cool of a product it was. Yet,
within a week, I've switched to something that in almost all ways is inferior.
Let's discuss why!

## What is goal

Before I go into details of what I liked / disliked about the tools I've tried,
I think it's important to think about what my goal is.

I want to learn how to read Japanese. Over the past 2 years, I've studied
Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and vocab words. I'm not moving super fast - but
I'm consistently doing it (just passed 800 days in a row!). I know 549 kanji
and 1,711 vocab words according to my [wkstats page](https://www.wkstats.com).

I have recently started trying to learn grammar so I can put some of this
kanji / vocab to use. I want to start reading some easy sentences. As part of that,
I really liked the idea of [sentence mining](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-sentence-study/).

The gist of it is: I want to find thousands of sentences and add them to some
tool so that I can then review them over and over until I can understand them
very well.

With that number of sentences - there's no way I can review them all every day.
So I need some way of filtering out sentences I'm understanding and some way
of repeating sentences that I'm not getting.

**This** is the core thing I need a tool to solve.

## Quizlet

Alright so with the goal established - let's talk about [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com).

**Benefits**

- Their UI is gorgeous and intuitive. I was easily able to get started making
  decks and entering sentences.
- Both their web app and mobile apps are very responsive and easy to use.
- The cards have a spectacular text-to-speech system built in, so I don't need
  to spend time searching for audio files of each sentence I add.
- There were a variety of ways to "test" yourself on the sentences. You can
  have multiple choice sentences, match stuff, type the answer, or just use
  straight up flashcards.
- It's super easy to share sets of sentences with other people.
- You can save things to your phone for offline practice.

**Downsides**

- The ultimate pitfall of Quizlet is how they handle whether or not you've
  "learned" a sentence. After I added some sentences, I would do my reviews as
  one might expect. If I got it right one time - the item would go back into
  my queue for the next time I reviewed. If I got it right again - the item
  would go into a permanent "mastered" location. It doesn't matter if this was
  all in the course of one day or even one hour. It's mind boggling to me how
  bad of an experience that is - especially considering how good the rest of the
  app is. My only option is to either reset the list all
  the time and go through them or somehow keep track of them outside of the app.
- Quizlet has a subscription fee associated with it ($26 / year) - so if I wanted to use it
  for a long time, the cost could add up.
- Quizlet doesn't handle furigana very well. I couldn't find any way to have it
  show the furigana in a clean way.

## Kitsun

After I realized I couldn't keep using Quizlet due to the horrible way it
handles "learning" things - I decided to try out [Kitsun](https://kitsun.io).
A few people swore by it on the WaniKani forums.

**Benefits**

- It uses a [SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) as I feel
  all good learning apps nowadays should.
- You can clearly see information about your reviews - such as what is coming
  up and when or even how many reviews you have in each category (novice,
  intermediate, expert, etc).
- You can easily import decks from other places like Anki or csv files.
- It has books that you can read and you can click on words to learn more
  about them.

**Downsides**

- The UI is bad. It's not _as_ bad as Anki - but it's rough. I struggled
  tremendously trying to figure out where to go or how to interact with things.
  For instance, on the home page, there's this giant blue button that says
  "lessons" and then a giant button next to it that says "reviews". Yet, clicking
  on them does absolutely nothing! It took me a long time to figure out how to
  even review items. This was a common theme throughout the site - not being
  sure what I could click on and what I couldn't.
- The settings for configuring a deck are confusing and displeasing to look at.
  There are literally two arrows for each each thing and the text boxes aren't
  big enough to even see all the numbers. It's not clear what many of these are
  and there's no way to hover over items to get an explanation as one would expect
  in modern web pages.
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/kitsun.PNG" alt="Kitsun" style="display: block;  margin-left: auto;  margin-right: auto;" />
- Making cards is horrifically confusing. I wanted to make a card for a sentence
  and none of the templates offered to me were of great use. It then took me a
  long time to figure out how to even _make_ a card. There were so many options
  and it wasn't clear to me what I needed to do to get text to appear on the card.
- Making cards is much slower than other options.
- It's the most expensive option I found. You can get a lifetime subscription for
  $199 or pay a monthly fee of $8 a month. It is nice to have the lifetime option -
  but it would take a long time for that to be worth it.
- There's no mobile app - so no way for me to practice on my phone without internet.

## Mochi

From there, I decided to look at [Mochi](https://mochi.cards/). Honestly, though,
this was a super short experience before I dropped it. I couldn't actually figure
out how to make a card that had a front and a back. It also was _only_ a web app
and in order to even get it to sync to devices I would have had to buy a
subscription. There is no mobile app as well. At $5 a month - it's also fairly
expensive and there's no option for a lifetime purchase.

## Anki

So lastly we arrive to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and ooh boy
is there a lot to say about this product.

**Benefits**

- Is easily the most customizable of all the options. If you want to tell it to
  have a review after 17 minutes, then the next one after 281 minutes, and add a
  modifier of 117% for if you get it right then you can do that. It may be insanely
  confusing to do that or what the options even are - but heck you can do it.
- Is free for use on the computer and the mobile app is only $25 for lifetime use.
- Has a _ton_ of community support. People have decks for everything and have had
  these decks for years.
- There's a lot of youtube videos explaining all parts of the app that may confuse
  you. There's also a bunch of posts throughout the web that explain more about it.
- The add-ons can enable so many amazing features. You want automatic text-to-speech
  from Google translate? Bam. What about automatic furigana when you post Kanji? Bam!
- Once you get going entering sentences, it's the fastest option I found. It's very
  easy to continuously add sentences with the same tags - and the automatic furigana
  was extremely useful.
- Has a great mobile app that I can use without internet to study.

**Downsides**

- It looks like a product a developer made in a basement in the 90s.
- Oh my goodness the UI is so confusing. It took me hours of digging through
  stuff, talking with my partner, and watching videos to figure out how to set stuff
  up.
- You have to "sync" stuff to get it to go between devices. Who wants to remember
  to press a sync button each time they save something? lol
- Half the options in the app don't make sense to me even after going through docs.
- Trying to understand where to go to change anything is difficult. Is the option
  in a deck? In a template? In a card? Somewhere else?
- There's so many versions and half the things only work on specific versions.
- Many add-ons don't work on mobile so you finally find something cool and then sad days
  you can't use it on your phone.

## Why Anki was the winner

At the end of the day - the most important thing for me was to have a tool that
I could enter sentences into quickly and then have that tool test me on it over
time in an intelligent manner. I also needed to be able to use my phone or
computer to enter sentences or study them.

Right away that filtered out Quizlet and Mochi for me - so it came down to Kitsun
or Anki. Even though Kitsun had a slightly better UI, I found it actually much
harder to get used to. While Anki was ugly - it was consistent and I felt like I
could get into a better flow with it. I kept expecting Kitsun to be better because
of the UI so even though it was so similar to Anki - it made me more frustrated
because of that lol. Furthermore, Anki has better community support
and is significantly cheaper.

I think Kitsun could definitely improve over time but, for now, I'm going to stick
with Anki.

## What, if any, do you use and why?

If you're reading this and have used any of these or any others - I'm super curious
what you used and why? What was the most important thing to you?
