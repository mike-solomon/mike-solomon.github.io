Recently I've begun noticing how important it is to know how to conjugate
Japanese verbs. For instance, even though I may know the verb `食べる` (to eat),
I didn't know how I would change that if I wanted to say something like,
"I ate" or "I will eat" or "I did not eat" or even "I want to eat." I began
trying to look up some rules and wow was it difficult to find beginner friendly
places! Below I'll talk about the three groups of verbs I learned about and
what places I found useful or not.

> Reminder that I'm learning Japanese so don't inherently trust anything below!

## The different verb groups

From what I've seen, there are three groups for Japanese verbs. They each have
a few different names depending on the place that's describing them. Let's go
through each of them.

Note that I found the [Kanji Link](https://www.kanji-link.com/en/grammar/n5/)
website to be the easiest way to understand these groups. Their videos were
short, too the point, and beginner friendly. Much of the information below
will be me summarizing that into words.

They also have a [Verb Chart](https://www.kanji-link.com/docs/en_gram_n5_verbgroups.png)
that summarizes this very well, too!

### Irregular verbs / Group 3 verbs

Even though this group is referred to as the "irregular" group - it actually is
the easiest in my mind. That's because there's only 2 verbs in all of
Japanese that fall into this group.

Those verbs are `する` (to do) and `来る` (to come). When conjugating these,
`する` becomes `し` + something and `来る` becomes `き` + something.

For instance, if you want to make verbs polite and in the present tense,
you add `ます` after you make some change to the verb. So to make the polite
form of `する` you first make the change to `し` then you add `ます` to
the end to become `します`. The exact same thing happens with `来る` where it
becomes `きます`.

In another post, I'll talk about the different types of tenses there are and how
to make them (such as polite, past, negative, etc). Just gotta learn that first haha.

### Ichi-dan verbs / Group 2 verbs / る (ru) verbs / iru or eru verbs

This group has a lot of names in part because of the difficulty of recognizing
verbs that belong in this group vs. the last remaining group.

One of the most common ways of denoting this group is by calling it `ru` verbs.
However, a verb ending in `ru` could belong to all three groups - so some
people refer to this group as `iru` / `eru` verbs instead. That's because _all_ verbs
that end in `aru`, `uru` or `oru` don't belong in this group. Also, _most_ verbs
that end in `iru` or `eru` _do_ belong in this group.

Unfortunately, that _most_ part is a bit tricky since there's no rule that I'm
aware of that can be easily used to categorize verbs that end in `iru` or `eru`.
Most places just say to memorize these, or read enough to be aware of them, or
look them up in the dictionary. Some of the special verbs that I've learned that
end in iru or eru that don't belong in this group are `いる` (to need),
`入る` (to enter), and `走る` (to run).

With all that being said, this group of verbs _is_ nice in the sense that
conjugating them is pretty easy - you just drop the `る` at the end of the verb
and replace it with whatever modifier there is depending on the tense you're
using.

For instance, if we take the word `食べる` (to eat) and want to make that polite +
present tense, we just drop the `る` and add `ます` to become `食べます`. Not too bad,
right?

### Go-dan verbs / Group 1 verbs / う (u) verbs

If a verb does not fall into one of the two categories above, then it falls into
this category. The reason this is called `u` verbs sometimes is because all Japanese
verbs that are in the present / plain form end with an `う` sound.

This makes many verbs really easy to categorize - as if they end in an `う` sound and
_don't_ end with `る` - then they are in this group.

The problem becomes if a verb ends with a `る` - and the rule is the same thing
mentioned in the previous section. If the verb ends with `aru`, `uru`, or `oru`,
then it belongs in this group. If the verb ends with `iru` or `eru` - then it's
_most likely_ not in this group - but there are a few notable exceptions.

To conjugate this group of verbs, it's helpful to look at a Hiragana chart. Here
is one that Kanji Link uses that's shortened to only include the columns that verbs
can end in:

![hiragana chart](https://www.kanji-link.com/docs/en_gram_n5_verb_masu.png)

To conjugate these verbs, you simply find the character the verb ends in and change
that to be the character from the previous row.

So if a verb ends in `む` - then conjugating it would change that to `み`. Likewise,
`す` would become `し` and so on.

Let's pick a real example - the verb `消す` (to turn off / to erase). It ends in
`す` so we would change that to `し` and the verb would become `消し` + something.
The polite present form would be, `消します`.

## Other places I tried that I didn't find useful

There were a variety of sites and videos I watched to try and understand the
verb groups. Other than the Kanji Link one I mentioned above, I didn't find
any of these particularly useful. That being said, I think it's worth calling
out the places I went to and why I didn't like them. It's possible that other
people may find these useful as everyone learns different!

  - I found the English on this page to be difficult to parse and the lack of visuals a bit of a challenge to wrap my head around.
- [Imambi](http://www.imabi.net/regularverbsi.htm)
  - Went _way_ too far with verbs and categorizing them. Might be useful for people that are super into grammar - but, as it stands, I don't want to read about "Transitive" vs. "Auxilary" verbs. This just feels too complex for a beginner.
- [Wasabi](https://www.wasabi-jpn.com/japanese-grammar/japanese-verbs-u-verbs-and-ru-verbs-and-conjugation/)
  - While this looks pretty - it's missing a lot of key points around conjugation and it doesn't do a great job of helping you figure out which verb belongs in which group.
- [Japanese Ammo With Misa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4simApUbuI)
  - I found this video to be too drawn out. The core conjugation / groups can be summarized in such a short period of time - yet this video is 30+ minutes long!
- [Wikipedia Commons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf)
  - WAY too much information here - with no clear explanations. Probably useful if you are already familiar with the concepts and just want to have a cheat sheet to look up things with.

## Concluding Thoughts

Finding a place that made this click for me was hard - but I'm glad I persevered and
kept looking around for something that fit me. Hopefully this post helped you or will
help guide you to something that works for you!

If you already knew about the verb groups - where did you learn about them from? Any
recommendations for others?

Thanks for reading ^.^
