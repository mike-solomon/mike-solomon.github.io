In the last post we talked about
`this` (`これ`) and `that` (`それ` and `あれ`) in Japanese. However, those words we talked about _do
not_ work if we wanted to say "this book" or "that umbrella" in Japanese. Why not? What should we
say instead? Below we'll go into more detail!

## この / その / あの vs. これ / それ / あれ

In English, when we say "_this_ is a book" and "_this_ book is mine", we use the same `this` word in
both places. The same thing applies to "_that_ is an umbrella" and "_that_ umbrella is mine". There
is no distinction between their uses (pronoun vs. adjective).

> A "pronoun" is a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase (such as I, you, she, it, or this.) An "adjective" is a word that describes a person, place, or thing (such as big, round, old, or even this).

In Japanese, though, those sentences _do not_ use the same word. If you are using the word `this`
or `that` in the adjective form, it **must** be followed by a noun.

`この`, `その`, and `あの` are adjectives in Japanese that mean the same thing as their counterparts
`これ`, `それ`, and `あれ` but require a noun to follow them instead of a particle.

So, if we look at the example "this book is mine" - I **could not** say `このは本私のです`. As `この`
is followed by the particle `は` instead of a noun. I should, instead, say `この本は私のです` (As
for this book, it is mine). Like the `これ` counterpart, the assumption is that the book I'm talking
about is close to me (the speaker).

What if I wanted to say "that umbrella is mine"? If we assume the umbrella is closer to you (the
listener), I would say `その傘は私のです`.

And what about if I was standing next to you and pointed to my cat that was far away from both of
us and said, "I love that cat"? I would then say `あの猫は大好きです`.

In all of these examples, we can see that `this` or `that` is followed by a noun when we use
`[こ|そ|あ]の`.

## This vs. these and that vs. those

In English, if we are talking about a group of things, we switch from `this` to `these` or `that` to
`those`. Japanese, however, does not differentiate between the two.

What does that mean for our Japanese sentences above? It turns out they can have multiple different
meanings and you have to have context to truly understand them.

For instance, the sentence, `この本は私のです` _could_ mean "this book is mine" - but it _could also_
mean "these books are mine."

Likewise, if I said `あの猫は大好きです` - it _could_ mean "I love that cat" - but it _could also_
mean "I love those cats".
